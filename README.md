===

> WARNING: This is a work in progress and is not ready for production use. Breaking changes will occur regularly.

FollowingWind is a Flutter package that provides a Tailwind CSS like implementation for Flutter. It is designed to be a simple and easy to use way to style your Flutter applications.

This package is inspired by [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs. 

Not designed to be a 1:1 implementation of Tailwind CSS, FollowingWind aims to provide a similar experience for Flutter developers but with an API that is familiar for Flutter developers.
